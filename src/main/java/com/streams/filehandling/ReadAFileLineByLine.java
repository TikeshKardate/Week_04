/*
9. Read a Large File Line by Line
📌 Problem Statement:
Develop a Java program that efficiently reads a large text file (500MB+) line by line and prints only lines containing the word "error".
Requirements:
Use BufferedReader for efficient reading.
Read line-by-line instead of loading the entire file.
Display only lines containing "error" (case insensitive).
